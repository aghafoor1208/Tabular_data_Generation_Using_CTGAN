# Generated Data using CTGAN

To augment the **PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset**, we used **Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGANs)** to generate synthetic tabular data. CTGAN is designed specifically to handle structured datasets and is highly effective at generating realistic data that preserves the statistical properties of the original dataset.

CTGAN is a type of **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** optimized for generating synthetic data for structured, tabular datasets, such as those with continuous and categorical features.

---

## Steps for Data Generation

1. **Model Setup**:  
   The CTGAN model consists of two components:
   - **Generator**: The generator creates synthetic data samples.
   - **Discriminator**: The discriminator distinguishes real data from synthetic data, helping the generator improve over time.

2. **Training the CTGAN**:  
   - We trained the CTGAN model on the **PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset** to learn the underlying distribution of both continuous and categorical features.
   - The model was trained over several epochs until it produced synthetic data that closely resembles the statistical properties of the original dataset.

3. **Generating Synthetic Data**:  
   After training, we used the model to generate synthetic data with the same structure (features and target variable) as the original dataset.

4. **Evaluating the Data**:  
   The synthetic data was evaluated by comparing the statistical properties (means, variances, and distributions) of both the real and generated datasets. Visual tools such as **histograms** and **boxplots** were used to ensure the generated data closely matched the original dataset's characteristics.

## Benefits of Using CTGAN for Data Augmentation

- **Handling Imbalanced Data**:  
  CTGAN can generate synthetic samples for the minority class, which can help balance imbalanced datasets and improve model performance.

- **Data Distribution Preservation**:  
  CTGAN maintains both the **correlations** between features and their **marginal distributions**, ensuring that synthetic data remains realistic and useful for model training.
